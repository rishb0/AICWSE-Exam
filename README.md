- LAMP Stack – Deployed Apache2, PHP, and MySQL to support WordPress  
- SSL/TLS Implementation – Generated and installed certificates to enable secure HTTPS  
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) – Used plugins and configurations to block malicious queries and attacks  
- WordPress Hardening – Disabled XML-RPC, restricted REST API access, set strict file permissions, and enforced .htaccess rules  
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) – Enhanced login security using a TOTP-based authenticator app  
- IP Blacklisting and Geoblocking – Prevented unwanted access from known malicious IPs or regions  
- Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts – Enabled activity logs and notifications for suspicious behavior
